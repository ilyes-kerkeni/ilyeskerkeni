As an engineering student in applied mathematics at ENSTA Paris and master 2 “Probabilitées et finance (ex DEA EL KAROUI)”, I have developed a passion for quantitative finance and machine learning as applied to financial markets. With my strong analytical skills and deep understanding of mathematical modeling, I have gained valuable experience as a quantitative researcher trainee, developing rich models for autocallable products and conducting calibration to var swaps, covar swaps, vol swaps, and options. Currently, as a quant-data scientist trainee, I continue to develop my expertise in quantitative finance and machine learning, applying advanced statistical techniques to extract insights from complex financial data. With a commitment to continued learning and a passion for innovation, I am excited to make meaningful contributions to the field of quantitative finance and to help drive success for my organization."
